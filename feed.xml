Tisakorean is experiencing a major moment with a feature on Chance The Rapper’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoHwMlxmQkE&quot;&gt;GRoCERIES&lt;/a&gt;” single and as the creator of the #woahchallenge that has ripped through the nation and has been taken up by the culture’s biggest names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tisakorean is far more than a viral trend though. The Texas native started out as a dancer in Houston, evolving into a producer and soon after turning his attention to rap. His unique sound stems from often rapping off-beat with eccentric bars - refreshing signs that creativity that is still very much alive in this digital age. “WERKKK,” his 2017 video, was a shot across the bow: a wild slice of dance-rap that introduced his startling new voice and deeply personal sense of style. Following its success, he released “Dip,” the relaxed yet propulsive blast of Texan hip-hop that has racked over a million views on YouTube, spawned a viral dance craze on TikTok, and prompted a remix from Lil Uzi Vert. His new mixtape* &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/0EWCcpFd5S84UWq996nvJd?si=wCdjGFe4SxWRxmlrucQkMw&quot;&gt;A Guide to Being A Partying Freshman&lt;/a&gt; *further cements him as a generational phenomenon. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tisakorean-a-guide-to-being-a-partying-freshman/&quot;&gt;Pitchfork explains in their review&lt;/a&gt;, Tisakorean offers up “one of the first mixtapes that can be enjoyed on Instagram, TikTok, and Triller”. The industry’s interest in Tisakorean is further amplified by his long list of cosigns which include heavy hitters like Chance The Rapper,** **Lil Uzi Vert, A$AP Rocky, Kenny Beats, Zach Fox, &amp;amp; more. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefader.com/2019/04/09/tisakorean-interview-dip-the-woah-guide-to-being-a-partying-freshman&quot;&gt;FADER&lt;/a&gt; even dedicated a long piece on Tisakorean, dubbing him “the soapiest rapper alive”. Opposition is excited to work closely with Tisakorean, and will be distributing the rising rapper’s next EP.&lt;/p&gt;

Savage was reportedly being locked down 23 hours of the day as a part of the US’s questionable immigration policies. Savage’s lawyer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tasneemnashrulla/21-savage-ice-arrest-immigration-status&quot;&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; regarding the arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been an outpouring of support from the public, ranging from U.S. Rep Hank Johnson to hip-hop mogul Jay Z, who hired a lawyer to help Savage’s case. Black Lives Matters organizers started a petition to stop the deportation which already gained over 400,000 signatures from US citizens in less than a week. Savage’s notability helps shed a light on the policies that need to be changed regarding millions of immigrants facing similar circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday night, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mic/status/1095404673207459840&quot;&gt;website Mic shared a video&lt;/a&gt; that included hip hop heavyweights Kendrick Lamar, SZA, J Cole, and DJ Khaled supporting 21 Savage and other undocumented immigrants facing deportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After nine days in detainment, 21 Savage has been released on bond with attorneys of the ICE dropping an aggravated felony charge against him as cause for his deportation. An expedited hearing in immigration court is expected to take place in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSDvKdIQOwTfcyOimSi9oYA&quot;&gt;Future&lt;/a&gt; has been a long standing pillar in hip hop, Opposition partner, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0BletW9phE4xHFM44q4qKA&quot;&gt;Juice WRLD&lt;/a&gt;, is cementing his place as one of the more introspective, darker rappers we’ve seen in awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has easily become the most exciting collab in rap this year also sees a majority of songs done by producer extraordinaire Wheezy. Together, this trifecta of rap’s finest talent deliver a hallucinogenic experience paired with trap-inspired beats. While both rappers are distinctly different in age and place - Future, 34, from Atlanta, and Juice WRLD, 19, from Chicago - they share a rare talent of making melancholic lyrics of falling deep into women and drugs feel fresh for 16 songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday night, the rappers released three music videos for WRLD ON DRUGS. One of the best pairings of Future and Juice WRLD’s melodies can be heard on “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QurRU2tyOFA&quot;&gt;No Issue&lt;/a&gt;”. Opposition partner Cole Bennett was enlisted to the direct the “extraterrestrial” music video that includes alienesque blue women, Future and Juice WRLD in matching silver outfits, and a silver DeLorean. With Cole Bennett behind the camera, the concept works. This isn’t the first time Juice WRLD has collaborated with Cole Bennett and Lyrical Lemonade. His first music video for the hit single, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3EJICKwITw&quot;&gt;All Girls Are The Same&lt;/a&gt;” that skyrocketed the young Chicago rapper onto new levels of popularity, was directed by Cole and has received over 65 million views. Clearly, there’s a chemistry between the two as Cole found himself directing Juice WRLD’s next hit, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzB1VGEGcSU&quot;&gt;Lucid Dreams&lt;/a&gt;” which currently has over 212 million views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music videos for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WkySwfWh6Y&quot;&gt;Realer N Realer&lt;/a&gt;” and the title track, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U1YJcDhk9E&quot;&gt;WRLD on Drugs&lt;/a&gt;” were also released at the same time. Working as montages of the trap and the two rappers, including a cameo by Young Thug in both, the videos take on a raw view of a drug-ridden world. While Cole’s video is stylistically attuned to “No Issue”’s beat and this exciting new partnership in rap, the two other videos touch on the drug world and those it affects the most.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Justine</name></author><category term="Juice WRLD" /><category term="Future" /><category term="WRLD On Drugs" /><category term="Atlanta" /><category term="Chicago" /><category term="Cole Bennett" /><category term="Lyrical Lemonade" /><category term="Young Thug" /><category term="Hip hop music videos" /><category term="new hip hop" /><category term="hip hop news" /><summary type="html">Future and Juice Wrld put the rumors of a joint album to rest and released WRLD ON DRUGS last week.

&lt;p&gt;After finding viral breakout success with the music video for his single “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGScxakv49Q&quot;&gt;Killamonjaro&lt;/a&gt;” in 2017 with over 20 million views on YouTube, KILLY has rapidly become an artist to keep your eyes on. With his steady stream of releases that have earned him two gold-certified singles, the Bajan/Filipino has developed a refined lyricism alongside his signature melodies and hard-hitting production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While KILLY is breaking into the rap game during the SoundCloud rap era, his sonic sensibilities set him apart from the crowded scene - enough to already surpass 200 million streams with his first project, “Surrender Your Soul”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the twenty-one year old has just released his much anticipated KILLSTREAK EP to an eager and ready fanbase. After a new deal between his Secret Sound Club label and Opposition’s Distribution and Label Services, which taps into a massive network of influencers for digital promotion, &lt;a href=&quot;http://smarturl.it/KILLSTREAK&quot;&gt;KILLSTREAK is now streaming across all major music platforms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the hype around KILLY continues to grow with each new release, 2018 has proven to be his biggest year with festival appearances and tours across the world. The young rapper recently tied up appearances at Rolling Loud Miami, JMBLYA, FVDED in the Park, VELD, Osheaga, alongside headlining a World Tour. Next up, we’ll see the rapper take on Europe as well as a performance at Rolling Loud Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Justine</name></author><category term="KILLY" /><category term="Opposition" /><category term="Toronto" /><category term="Vancouver Hip Hop" /><category term="Killamonjaro" /><category term="Opposition Distribution and Label Services" /><category term="KILLSTREAK" /><category term="new hip hop" /><category term="hip hop news" /><category term="soundcloud" /><category term="new rap songs" /><summary type="html">Opposition is proud to announce our first full length project release with rapper, KILLY’s new EP KILLSTREAK.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CRASH RARRI Teases New Album with “The 6” Music Video</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/post/news/crash-rarri-teases-new-album-with-the-6-music-video/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CRASH RARRI Teases New Album with “The 6” Music Video" /><published>2018-09-07T16:03:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-09-07T16:03:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/post/news/crash-rarri-teases-new-album-with-the-6-music-video</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/post/news/crash-rarri-teases-new-album-with-the-6-music-video/">&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2yfDuOWqqs3vb5GanTe8kw&quot;&gt;CRASH RARRI&lt;/a&gt;’s upcoming double album GHETTO / GREATNESS on the horizon, the Columbus rapper just released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FebhWtvEbXY&quot;&gt;the music video for “The 6” on WorldStarHipHop&lt;/a&gt;.
